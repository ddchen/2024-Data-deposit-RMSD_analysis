# File
In ``main``, we have the following files about TIMSS math items:

- ``T19_G8_Item Parameters_Math.xlsx`` is the	item parameter file from TIMSS 2019.
- ``T19_G8_ItemInfo_Math.xlsx`` is the	item information file from TIMSS 2019.

They can also be downloaded at [TIMSS's website](https://timss2019.org/international-database/)

In addition, we have the following .RData files showing the simulated binary item responses:

	"simulate_00values for settings.RData"		| values of simulation settings
	"simulate_NO.DIF_ngrp=2.RData"		        | simulated response data - no DIF, for two groups
	"simulate_NO.DIF_ngrp=5.RData"		        | simulated response data - no DIF, for five groups
	"simulate_NO.DIF_ngrp=10.RData"		        | simulated response data - no DIF, for ten groups
	"simulate_NO.DIF_ngrp=15.RData"		        | simulated response data - no DIF, for 15 groups
	"simulate_WITH.DIF_ngrp=2.RData"		      | simulated response data - with DIF, for two groups
	"simulate_WITH.DIF_ngrp=5.RData"		      | simulated response data - with DIF, for five groups
	"simulate_WITH.DIF_ngrp=10.RData"		      | simulated response data - with DIF, for ten groups
	"simulate_WITH.DIF_ngrp=15.RData"		      | simulated response data - with DIF, for 15 groups

Note that we only cover ``ngrp = 2, 5, 10, and 15`` here (instead of ``ngrp = 2, 3, 4, ..., 15``) due to our limited capacity for data storage.
